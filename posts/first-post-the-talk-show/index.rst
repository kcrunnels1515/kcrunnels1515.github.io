==================
The Talk Show Skit
==================

I'm not exactly sure what I was thinking about when I wrote this, I think I had just watched a bunch of "A Bit of Fry and Laurie" and I was anxious to try my hand at mind-warpingly anal characters.
Bob is inspired by Steven Fry. I don't think Milly is inspired by anyone in particular.

	[man and woman walk onto the stage, both are formally dressed, they smile and wave, holding signs saying “Wild applause, or else.”. they sit in two chair, and lounge. After several moments, they remember where they are, and turn towards the crowd.]

  Milly Quetoast: Hello, and welcome, you lucky, lucky peons, to “An Oscar-Prize Winning Title”. I’m Milly.

  Bob: And I’m Bob.

  [forgetting the audience, they converse. Bob strokes thighs continuously through entire scene.]

  Bob: Was I sexy enough?

  Milly: Yes, yes, I think it didn’t cause me to vomit cutely in revulsion, no.

  Bob: Super.

  [they turn back to crowd.]

  Bob: Now, haha, I’m afraid you will have to be, haha,  compliant in all, haha, matters, haha, today.

  Milly: Haha.

  B: Otherwise, I’m sorry to say, haha, we would, haha, mm, heehee, have to, of course, braise you slowly over a pit of lively burning cigarette butts, age gently in chemically water-proofed plywood barrels, slice thinly, garnish with sinful sprinkles of arsenic and ricin, and market as All-Natural Indonesian Turkey Breast.
	
  M: There will of course, be a slim profit margin, so you will also be fined five thousand dollars before braising.

  B: Now, m’ colleague, what do we have in store tonight?

  M: Well, I thought that we should engage in meaningful conversation, regale interesting personal stories, and encourage that audience to join in.

  B: Mmm. [looks slightly ill.]

  M: But I was having a tooth out and was under anesthetic, so I amended my lineup once I was feeling more coherent.
	
  B: Ah. You had me a bit worried there, Milly.
	
  M: Thank you. [turns to audience.] Can we have a pointless round of applause, here please? [if audience is hesitant, she says, “Do you know, All-Natural Indonesian Turkey Breast grossed 2 billion last year?”] Thank you.
	
  B: Yes, we will be exchanging banter, witticisms, and vapidly blather away to ourselves, until we, or the audience die of internal hemorrhaging, organ failure, and cerebral vacuum collapse.
	
  M: Yes.
	

  B: Yes. Mm.
	
  [moment of silence.]
	
  M: [looks at bob’s legs.] Oh, Bob, m’ colleague, um… Are those new thighs, that you’re wearing, there?
	
  B: [looks down with clearly faked surprise.] Oh! You noticed them, did you? [stands up and rips off pants?]
	
  M: Yes, yes, I did.
	
  B: Well, these aren’t actually new, they’re my thighs I had when I was in, ooh, must have been my twenties. I had them replaced with some from an 70-year old senator– You know how it is when you’re young, pinching pennies, groping quarters, and massaging dollar bills with oil. They were cheap, had, understandable, never been used, and, I thought, why not save the sexy thighs for when I really need them: my mid-50s.
	
  [person collapses in audience, is dragged out.]
	
  M: Indeed. I didn’t think to save my originals, but I am thinking of, well, having them replaced with Taylor Swift’s.
	
  B: Oh, ambitious. Tell us, tell us, how are you going to finance this, this little venture?
	
  M: Oh, I’m going to mortgage my husband.
	
  B: Ah, there you go.
	
  M: Thank you. [turns to audience.] Can we have a pointless round of applause, here please? [if audience is hesitant, she says, “Do you know, All-Natural Indonesian Turkey Breast grossed 2 billion last year?”] Thank you.
	
  B: Super. Uh, now, Milly, I understand, that is, my sources tell me, that is, I understand that, uh, you are, in fact, a woman. Are my sources, are they correct in this respect?
	
  M: Yes, yes, I am, surprisingly enough, not many people think to ask that.
	
  B: Oh? Really. Kudos Bob. [turns toward audience.] Can we have a pointless round of applause, here, please? Thank you.
	
  M: Thank you.
	
  B: Milly, uh,  Milly, Milly, uh, Milly. Milly. Do you have any advice, for, for the other members of your gender, which, we can be sure, are lurking out there somewhere, yearning to become lobotomized talk show hosts?
	
  [person in audience collapses, and is dragged out.]
	
  M: One word, Bob.
	
  B: One?
	
  M: One.
	
  B: Well, [shifting in his seat.] this is certainly a shocker, ladies, and to a more or less analog of gentlemen, we, ah, seem to have a bit, a tad, a smear of trouble here, as, as is readily evident, we talk show hosts are paid by the word. Therefore, [turning to Milly] I beg, I entreat you to extend your advice, to at least a sentence.
	
  M: I’ll see what I can do, Bob.
	
  B: Super. And, your advice?
	
  M: Well, I’ve seen a few things in my time. Unpleasant things, like Jeff Sessions in a speedo, and I’ve come to this simple axiom to happiness and unreasonable amounts of money.
	
  B: Oh, bravo. Can we have a pointless round of applause here, please? Thank you.
	
  M: Thank you.
	
  B: And this axiom is?
	
  M: Well, Bob, I’ve thought long and hard about this, and the answer I’ve come to, inescapably, is this: “Breast Enhancement”.
	
  B: Oh, bravo, bravo. Knew you would drag it out unnecessarily in the end. Can we have a round of ersatz  approval here, please? Thank you, thank you.
	
  M: Thank you.
	
  B: Now comes the sexiest, and, in my opinion, sensual part of the show, where we make the audience feel socially and financially disadvantaged. Milly.
	
  M: Bob.
	
  B: [lets out enormous sigh.] My God, I’ve had a rotten week. Went over to the Prime Minister’s house for tea, and she took no notice of most my suggestions. Didn’t comment on my new, sexy thighs, either.
	
  M: [lets out a bigger sigh.] Fah! My takeover bid of the National Inquirer fell through, so now I’m not going to get my 40 million dollar bonus!
	
  B: On top of that, I picked up a bottle of Chateau Lafite for the weekend, and it was completely the wrong vintage!
	
  M: Also, everything in my wardrobe is ancient! There are dresses in there probably 5 years old!
	
  B: And to top everything, all of my stock lost at least 3 points!
	
  M: But worst, Justin Bieber called and said he didn’t like my hair!
	
  B: My God, how I wish they’d allow us to drink during this part of the show.
	
  M: Yyygghh… [collapses.]
	
  B: [looks over at Milly, then back at audience.] Well, is seems that Milly is done for, cerebral vacuum collapse, most likely. And I’m counting not a few of you who seem on the verge yourselves. Well, as I drift ever closer towards organ failure, I think I will futilely pretend to care that my voice is slowly, or not so slowly, sapping your will to ligghhh…[Bob and at least two audience members collapse.]
